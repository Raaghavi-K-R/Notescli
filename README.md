# 📝 NOTECLI - A Simple Command-Line Notes Manager

NOTECLI is a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool that allows users to securely create, read, update, and delete notes from the terminal. It integrates with Auth0 for authentication and MongoDB (via Atlas) as the backend database. Built with Flask, it offers a seamless way to manage your notes from any system.

## 📦 Installation

You can install NOTECLI globally on any system via PyPI:

## 🔑 Authentication

NOTECLI uses Auth0 for login. You must log in before using note commands.

```bash

```bash
notescli logout
```

To see the currently authenticated user:

```bash
notescli whoami
```

## 🌐 Backend Server

- Runs on `Flask` (default port `5000`)
- Secured by OAuth2 via Auth0
- Stores notes in MongoDB Atlas
- Each note is associated with a unique Auth0 user ID

Example API endpoints:
- `GET /notes` – get all notes
- `POST /notes` – create a new note
- `GET /notes/<id>` – fetch a specific note
- `PUT /notes/<id>` – update a note
- `DELETE /notes/<id>` – delete a note

---

## 🔐 Security

- All endpoints require a valid **Bearer Token**
- Tokens are verified against Auth0
- Notes are scoped per user using `user_id`

---

## 📡 Deployment

You can deploy the backend using:

```bash
python server/app.py
```

Or run on a remote VM and point the client to the appropriate IP (e.g., `http://13.71.28.224:5000`).
